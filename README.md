# CoRCWorkflows
Take a look at the [website](https://jdaas.github.io/CoRCWorkflows).

Workflows with the Copasi R Connector

The workflows on this website are created during the cause of my master thesis. Two new methods were added to the [CoRC](https://jpahle.github.io/CoRC) package: The Profile Likelihood method and the Sensitivity Analysis. Additionally new workflows with the Sigma Point Method are presented.
